# Python-for-Data-Science

## What is a piscine?

Much like the selection piscine, the project was divided into many small projects (modules), and each day introduced a new concept related to the language/paradigm/technology I chose to work on. Validating a piscine required more than just a day or two of investment.

To validate this piscine, I completed the following projects:

- **Python-0-Starting**
  I learned about the basics of the Python programming language.

- **Python-1-Array**
  I explored arrays, their manipulations, and worked on images.

- **Python-2-DataTable**
  I learned how to load, manipulate, and display data tables.

- **Python-3-OOP**
  I learned about classes and inheritance.

- **Python-4-Dod**
  I explored some structure design.
